# 🌩️ Cloud Repo Viewer

A simple cloud-based GitHub repo browser and editor built with **Node.js (Express)** for the backend and **React (Vite + Monaco Editor)** for the frontend.  
The idea is to let you **clone and explore repos directly in the browser** without using your computer’s internal storage like a local IDE.

---

## ✨ Features (Current)
- 📂 **Clone any public GitHub repo** to the server.  
- 📝 **Browse files & folders** in the repo.  
- 💻 **Edit files directly in the browser** using [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) (same engine VS Code uses).  
- 🔌 **Express backend** handles cloning repos and serving file content.  
- ⚡ **React frontend** displays repo explorer and editor.
